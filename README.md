A simple and fun game of Rock Paper Scissors using CSS3 animations and Coffeescript

This was started as a personal project to test out my design and development for real world use, and now I would like to see
it become a full-fledged online/offline game using HTML5 concepts and more advanced Javascript/Coffeescript and perhaps some
Sass thrown in as well. 

I have a lot of ideas of where I would like this project to go and we'll see how many of those ideas come to fruition
as I have time to keep working and updating the code/design.

If you have any suggestions or helpful advice, feel free to message me from my main github profile page.
